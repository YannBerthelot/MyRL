# MyRL
The goal of this project is to reimplement discrete RL agents for mostly personnal use and experiments. 
The spirit of this project is to provide simple gym compatible implementations of those agents that can easily be modified for students or experiments.

The agents currently implemented are : 
-SARSA : On-policy Q-table method
-Q-learning : Off-policy Q-table method
-Double Q-learning : Variance improved Q-learning
